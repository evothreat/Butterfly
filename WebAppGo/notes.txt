- if render login page, the url will be wrong
- avoid using raw urls in code
    * export in constants (f.e. LOGIN_URL) or
    * export in methods

- change uncapitalize unexported functions

- instead of imitating click on active tab, call functions directly?

- instead of adding job after input, update history tab (or other tabs) on click

- let the server return link to file after file upload

- add multiple entry manipulation (add job for many workers, delete etc.)
